    SAGEBewley

Clean, stable re-implementation of the Bewley/SAGE wellbeing model from
A. Conway's master's thesis ("Wellbeing and Macroeconomics: A SAGE approach").

Design goals (vs. the original `Bewley change11j` notebook):
  * No brute-force continuous inner optimization → discretize effort `e` and
    solve the household problem as a QuantEcon `DiscreteDP`. Fast and stable.
  * No 5-million-period simulation → the wealth distribution is the exact
    stationary distribution of the controlled Markov chain.
  * No fragile outer A-fixed-point / backward NaN loop → in the *canonical*
    model (notebook change `v11c`) the public good `A` enters utility
    additively and is INDEPENDENT of the agent's own action, so household
    policies do not depend on `A`. `A = Q` is therefore just an aggregate
    computed once from the stationary distribution.

Model (partial equilibrium, exogenous gross rate R, no firms):
  state  s = (a, z),  a ≥ 0 assets, z ∈ {low, high} productivity (Rouwenhorst)
  choice (a', e),     a' ≥ 0 next assets, e ∈ [0,1] labour effort, q = 1-e
  budget c + a' = R·a + α[z]·e·z·Z            (agency α scales labour income)
  u(c,e;z) = Γ·( c^(1-γ)/(1-γ) - ϕ·e^(1+ψ)/(1+ψ) ) + Λ·B[z]·A
             \\_____________ Material Gain U^c ____________/   \\__ Social U^s __/
  public good  A = Q = E[ 1 - e ]  over the stationary distribution.

NOTE (flagged modelling choice): because the canonical code removed the `q·A`
term, effort does NOT respond to the social good - `A`/`B` are a wellbeing
overlay, not an active choice margin. The thesis Euler eq. (14) keeps a B term;
the final code (and hence its figures) does not. We follow the code.

VERSIONS. v1.0 (git tag) is the thesis-faithful parametrization (γ=1.5, ψ=0.25,
ϕ=1.0). v1.1 (this file) replaces every free preference parameter with a
literature or calibrated value: γ=2 (EIS 0.5, Havranek 2015), ψ=2 (Frisch 0.5,
Chetty et al. 2011), β=0.96 and R=1.02 (Aiyagari-tradition annual values; the
thesis βR=0.9999 knife edge made the wealth distribution truncation-driven
under γ=2), ϕ=14.0 (calibrated to the INSEE 2010 time-use work share 0.53).
v1.1 also replaces the stationary-distribution solver: sparse power iteration
with a dense repeated-squaring fallback for slow-mixing chains (the old
iteration could stall silently and bias aggregates by over a percentage
point). Side benefit of the corrected calibration: hand-to-mouth share ~0.33
(Kaplan-Violante-Weidner range) and wealth Gini ~0.55, both far closer to data
than the thesis values. Reproduce thesis numbers via the v1.0 tag.
